## Tic Tac Toe: Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

> Ruby is an OOP language and nearly everything in Ruby is an object. This project aims to implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game using OOP methods like classes, inheritance, scope, variables, attr_readers & attr_writers as well as the DRY principle and other ruby components like hashes, arrays and data types etc.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Ruby-rubocop
- Github
- Gem

## In this Project there are 3 main files

`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
1. main.rb: This file is responsible for getting validated inputs from the user, outputting messages & board.
2. board.rb: This file is responsible for creating the board, possible win-moves and win/draw.
3. Validation.rb: This file is responsible for validation of moves and positions selected by user.

## ABOUT THE GAME

> The **TIC-TAC-TOE** game: is a 3 x 3 grid game that takes two player assigned symbol X and O. The players take turns playing by choosing any number between [1 - 9] when a number is picked the spot is marked X or O depending on the player that made the move. **Win** occurs when a player marks 3 grids either vertically, horizontally or diagonally first. Otherwise the game will be a **draw** if no spot are marked either way and all nine spots are marked.
